# Java Google Static Maps Builder

Java library for building a Google static map and returning an image of the map.

Uses the public Google Static Maps API found here: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/static-maps/intro

This was written in 2011 so minor edits may be needed to accommodate any changes to the GSM API.
